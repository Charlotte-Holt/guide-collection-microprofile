== What you'll learn

You will learn how to create and run a simple cloud native microservice. Then, you'll update the microservice that you created and deploy it to Kubernetes or Knative (optional if seeking to scale to zero). This will all be done by using the Eclipse MicroProfile Kabanero Collection with the link:https://appsody.dev/docs/using-appsody/cli-commands[Appsody CLI].

Kabanero's Eclipse MicroProfile Collection provides an application stack that enables the development and optimization of microservices. Application Stacks remove the burden of managing the full software development stack built for deploying to Kubernetes, all without being an expert on the underlying container technology or Kubernetes itself.  In enterprises, stacks are customized with their company standards and technology choices built in.  

Applications in this guide are written based on the Eclipse MicroProfile API specifications, built and run with the link:https://openliberty.io/[Open Liberty] runtime, and deployed to Kubernetes through a modern DevOps toolchain triggered via actions occuring in Git.  

// =================================================================================================
// Prerequisites
// =================================================================================================

== Prerequisites

* link:https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker] must be installed.
* link:https://appsody.dev/docs/getting-started/installation[Appsody] must be installed.
* *Optional*: If you have a repository that contains a set of custom collections, then you need the URL where the collections' `index.yaml` file is available. Use this URL to make your custom collections available with the Appsody CLI.
* *Optional*: If you are testing multiple microservices together, then you must have access to a local Kubernetes cluster for local development. If you are using Docker Desktop, you can enable Kubernetes from the menu by selecting Preferences -> Kubernetes -> Enable Kubernetes.  Other options include link:https://https://www.okd.io/minishift/[MiniShift] or Minikube.

// Configuring Appsody
// =================================================================================================

=== *Configuring Appsody*

*Note*: The use of the public Kabanero Collection Hub is only for the purposes of this guide. It is recommended that you make a private copy of the Kabanero Collection Hub and use it in the same way. However, this demonstration does not require that you make your own copy.

Add your Kabanero index to the Appsody CLI. The following example uses the public index for Kabanero Version 0.1.2.

To check the repositories that Appsody can already access, run the following command:
[role="command"]
----
appsody repo list
----

You see an output similar to the following example:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
appsody repo list
NAME        URL
*appsodyhub https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/incubator-index.yaml
----

Next, run the following command to add the Kabanero index:
[role="command"]
----
appsody repo add kabanero https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/v0.1.2/kabanero-index.yaml
----

Check the existing repositories to see that it was added:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
appsody repo list
NAME        URL
*appsodyhub https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/incubator-index.yaml
kabanero    https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/v0.1.2/kabanero-index.yaml
----

In this example, the asterisk (*) shows that `appsodyhub` is the default repository. Run the following command to set the Kabanero index as the default repository:
[role="command"]
----
appsody repo set-default kabanero
----

Check the existing repositories to see that it was updated:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
appsody repo list
NAME        URL
appsodyhub  https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/incubator-index.yaml
*kabanero   https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/v0.1.2/kabanero-index.yaml
----

*Recommendation*: In company settings it's best to remove the `appsodyhub` where a solution architect has curated the application stacks with technology choices and policies that reside in a private Collection Hub.  
----
appsody repo remove appsodyhub

appsody repo list

NAME     	URL                                                                                *kabanero	https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/v0.1.2/kabanero-index.yaml

----

Your Appsody CLI is now configured to use the Kabanero Collections. Next, you need to initialize your project.

// =================================================================================================
// Initializing your project
// =================================================================================================

=== *Initializing your project*

First, create a directory that will contain the project:
[role="command"]
----
mkdir -p ~/projects/simple-microprofile
cd ~/projects/simple-microprofile
----

Run the following command to initialize the project with the Appsody CLI:
[role="command"]
----
appsody init java-microprofile
----

The output from the command varies depending on whether you have an installation of Java and Maven on your system. If Java and Maven are installed on your system, you see an output similar to the following example:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
[InitScript] [INFO] -------------------< dev.appsody:java-microprofile >--------------------

[Warning] The stack init script failed: exit status 1
[Warning] Your local IDE may not build properly, but the Appsody container should still work.
[Warning] To try again, resolve the issue then run `appsody init` with no arguments.
----

Your project is now initialized.

// =================================================================================================
// Understanding the project layout
// =================================================================================================

=== *Understanding the project layout*

For context, the following image displays the structure of the project that you're working on:

image::/img/guide/microprofile-project-layout.png[link="/img/guide/microprofile-project-layout.png" alt="Project structure"]
{empty} +

It contains the following artifacts:

* `StarterApplication.java`, a JAX-RS Application class
* `server.xml`, an Open Liberty server configuration file
* `index.html`, a static HTML file
* `pom.xml`, a project build file

// =================================================================================================
// Running the Appsody development environment
// =================================================================================================

== Running the Appsody development environment

Run the following command to start the Appsody development environment:
[role="command"]
----
appsody run
----

The Appsody CLI launches a local Docker image that contains an Open Liberty server that hosts the microservice. After some time, you see a message similar to the following example:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
[Container] [INFO] [AUDIT   ] CWWKF0011I: The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet. The defaultServer server started in 20.235 seconds.
----

This message indicates that the server is started and you are ready to begin developing your application.

// =================================================================================================
// Creating and updating the application
// =================================================================================================

== Creating and updating the application

// Now you can create your business logic. The first thing to do is to add a REST endpoint. Navigate to the JAX-RS application endpoint to confirm that there are no JAX-RS resources //available. Go to the http://localhost:9080/starter URL. You see the following `HTTP 500` error that states that there are no provider or resource classes that are associated with the application:
// [source, role='no_copy']
// ----
// Error 500: javax.servlet.ServletException: At least one provider or resource class should be specified for application class "dev.appsody.starter.StarterApplication
// ----

Now you can create your business logic. Typically, you put your business logic in a JAX-RS resource. First, you need to add a REST endpoint.

Create a `StarterResource.java` class in the `src/main/java/dev/appsody/starter` directory. Open the file, populate it with the following code, and save it:
[source,java]
----
package dev.appsody.starter;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
@Path("/resource")
public class StarterResource {
    @GET
    public String getRequest() {
        return "StarterResource response";
    }
}
----

After you save, the source compiles and the application updates. You see messages similar to the following example:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
[Container] [INFO] [AUDIT   ] CWWKT0017I: Web application removed (default_host): http://85862d8696be:9080/
[Container] [INFO] [AUDIT   ] CWWKZ0009I: The application starter-app has stopped successfully.
[Container] [INFO] [AUDIT   ] CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://85862d8696be:9080/
[Container] [INFO] [AUDIT   ] CWWKZ0003I: The application starter-app updated in 0.988 seconds.
----

Now if you browse to the http://localhost:9080/starter URL, you no longer see the `HTTP 500` error. The resource that you just added is available at the `starter/resource` URL path. Go to the http://localhost:9080/starter/resource URL to see the following resource response:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
StarterResource response
----

Try changing the message in the `StarterResource.java` file, saving, and refreshing the page. You'll see that it takes only a few seconds for the change to take effect.

// =================================================================================================
// Stopping the Appsody development environment
// =================================================================================================
//
// == Stopping the Appsody development environment
// Use `Ctrl-C` to stop the Appsody development environment.

== Testing the application
If you are building an application composed of microservices you will ned to test in the context of the overall system.  First test your application and perform unit testing in isolation.  To test the application as part of the system, deploy the system and then the new application. You can choose how you want to deploy the system and application. If you have adequate CPU and memory to run MiniShift, the application, and the associated services, then you can deploy the application on a local Kubernetes that is running on your computer. Other options are enabling Docker Dekstop for Kubernetes which is described in the prereq section above.

You can also deploy the system, the application, and the associated services in a private namespace on a development cluster, where you will commit the microservices in git repos and deploy through a DevOps pipeline, not directly to Kubernetes. 

=== Testing locally on Kubernetes

After you finish writing your application code, the Appsody CLI makes it easy to deploy directly to a Kubernetes cluster for further local testing. Again this is valuable when wanting to test multiple microservices together or test w/ services the application will require.  

Ensure that your `kubectl` command is configured with cluster details, and run the following command to deploy your application:
[role="command"]
----
appsody deploy
----

This command builds a new Docker image that is optimized for production deployment and deploys the image to your local Kubernetes cluster. After some time you see a message similar to the following example:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
Deployed project running at http://localhost:30262
----

Run the following command to check the status of the application pods:
[role="command"]
----
kubectl get pods
----

You see an output similar to the following example:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
NAME                                  READY    STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE
appsody-operator-859b97bb98-htpgw      1/1     Running   0         3m2s
simple-microprofile-77d6868765-xkcpk   1/1     Running   0         31s
----

The pod that is related to your deployed application is similar to the following pod:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
simple-microprofile-77d6868765-xkcpk   1/1     Running   0         31s
----

After the `simple-microprofile` pod starts, go to the URL that was returned after you ran the `appsody deploy` command, and you see the Appsody microservice splash screen. To see the response from your application, point your browser to `<URL_STRING>/starter/resource`, where `<URL_STRING>` is the URL that was returned. For example, the http://localhost:30262 URL was returned in the previous example. Go to the http://localhost:30262/starter/resource URL to see the deployed application response.

Use the following command to stop the deployed application:
[role="command"]
----
appsody deploy delete
----

After you run this command, and the deployment is deleted, you see the following message:
[source, role='no_copy']
----
Deployment deleted
----

// =================================================================================================
// Deploying to Knative
// =================================================================================================

=== Testing with Knative Serving

You can choose to test the application deployed with Knative Serving to take advantage of 'Scale to zero'. Not all applications may be written effectively take advantage of scale to zero.  The Kabanero operator based installation will configure Knative on the Kubernetes cluster (i.e. OKD 3.11).  Due to the resource requirements to run Knative and it's prerequites it is not recommended to test locally. You should publish to Kubernetes using pipelines which is described below.  Contact your operations team for configuring the pipelines for deployment with Knative Serving enabled. 

// =================================================================================================
// Publishing to pipelines
// =================================================================================================

=== Publishing to Kubernetes using pipelines

After you develop and test your application in your local environment, it's time to publish it to your enterprise's pipeline to deploy into your company's Kubernetes Cluster for staging or production. This is done through Git.

Deploying your application to a Kubernetes cluster with Kabanero installed should always occur through the DevOps pipeline triggered from actions in Git.  This ensures as an application developer you can focus on your application code and not containers or Kubernetes infrastructure. For your company this ensures the build of the container image and deploy to Kubernetes (or Knative for scale to zero) happens in a secure and consistent manner to company standards.

To deliver it to the pipeline, simply push the project to the pre-configured Git repository that has a configured webhook to trigger the enterprise build and deploy pipeline.
